### About

Hi, I'm Aryan and am a final year undergraduate student pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science. I'm a mostly self-taught programmer with good problem solving and development experience. My work experiences include:

- [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/) (Upcoming Research Intern, Jan 2024)
- [ModelsLab](https://modelslab.com/) (Machine Learning Engineer, Oct 2023 - Jan 2024)
- [Morgan Stanley](https://www.morganstanley.com/) (Application Development Intern, May - Jul 2023)
- [Uptrain AI YC23](https://uptrain.ai/) (Machine Learning Intern, Mar - May 2023)

I'm passionate about generative models, reinforcement learning, computer graphics, cybersecurity and game development. Prior to working as an intern, I was an active [CTF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag_(cybersecurity)) player with interests in reverse engineering, cryptography, binary exploitation and osint. My current focus is on improving my knowledge about machine learning concepts, and I'm currently researching diffusion models.
